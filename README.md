# Catalysis ðŸ§ª

`catalysis` is a multi-platform CLI and Rust library to standardize publishing static websites to various platforms.
We aim to provide a foundational block to build [local-first](https://www.inkandswitch.com/local-first/) blogging experiences that don't require a centralized server to build and publish static sites.
